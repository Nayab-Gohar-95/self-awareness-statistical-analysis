# Statistical Analysis of Self-Awareness and Success

## Overview
This research project explores the impact of self-awareness on an individual's success using statistical analysis. The study involved collecting responses from **209 participants** through Google Forms and applying statistical tests to validate various hypotheses.

## Research Aim
The primary objective of this study was to analyze whether self-awareness influences an individual's success in aspects such as decision-making, goal-setting, and overall personal and professional growth.

## Data Collection
- **Participants**: 209 individuals
- **Survey Method**: Google Forms questionnaire
- **Data Format**: The dataset is available in `responses.xlsx`, containing all responses from participants.

## Statistical Methods Applied
We applied multiple statistical tests to analyze the relationship between self-awareness and different factors contributing to success:

1. **Chi-Square Test**: Used to determine the association between categorical variables.
2. **Z-Test**: Applied to test hypotheses related to population proportions and significance.

Each question in the survey was tested for statistical significance to determine how strongly self-awareness correlates with different aspects of success.

## Findings
Our analysis provided significant insights into how self-awareness contributes to success:
- **Decision Making**: Statistically significant relationship between self-awareness and effective decision-making.
- **Goal-Setting**: Individuals with higher self-awareness showed a greater ability to set and achieve personal and professional goals.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Participants with a high level of self-awareness also demonstrated better emotional regulation and resilience.

## Files in the Repository
- **responses.xlsx**: Contains all collected responses from the survey.
- **Self Awareness and its impact on individual's success.pptx**: Presentation slides summarizing the study, methods, and key findings.

## How to Use the Data
1. Open `responses.xlsx` in Excel or any spreadsheet tool to analyze the raw data.
2. Refer to the slides (`Self Awareness and its impact on individual's success.pptx`) for a visual summary of findings.
3. Perform your own statistical analysis using Python, R, or any statistical tool of choice.

## Future Work
- Expanding the dataset with a larger and more diverse population.
- Applying machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.
- Exploring additional psychological and behavioral factors linked to success.
